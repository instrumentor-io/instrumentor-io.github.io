# Instrumentor User Guide

Welcome! We are so glad to see you using Instrumentor platform. You can use the links on left hand side to find the topic of your interest, but here are basic system requirements...

**System Requirements**

Brwosers:

- Google Chrome
- Safari
- Firefox

Microphone access:

- Instrumentor empowers you to record a voice narration on your cases, thus, the web-application requires access to the microphone. When you visit Instrumentor for first time, we will ask for you permission to use microphone - please allow that. If you deny permission to access microphone, you will not be able to record voice narrations.

We expect out product to work on Microsoft Edge, but we do not routinely test on Microsoft Edge, so you may find some things that may not work as described.
