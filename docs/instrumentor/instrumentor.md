**System Requirements**

_Supported Browsers:_

_Microphone Access:_

- Instrumentor empowers you to record voice narrations for your cases. Therefore, the web application requires access to your microphone. During your initial visit to Instrumentor, we will request permission to access your microphone. Please grant this permission. If you deny microphone access, you won't be able to record voice narrations.

While we anticipate our product to function on Microsoft Edge, we don't conduct routine testing on this browser. Consequently, you may encounter some features that may not work as described. Your understanding is appreciated.
