## Sharing a case

You can share cases you captured using MediX or uplaoded yourself with other Instrumentor platform users. By default, a case is NOT shared with anyone and only you can view the case.

Sharing can be of two types:

1. Evaluation Request: In this type, you can share the case with other users to get feedback and evaluation of your performance. Other users can score your based on the standardized forms,
2. Demonstration/Discussion: In this type, you can share your knowledge, techqniue, demo your skills for a particular case. In this sharing type, there's no scoring involved.

You can share a case with more than one users and feedback/review notes from each user is kept separate and only you can view feedback from everyone.
