## Creating summary video for a case

Instrumentor lets you leverage all the hard work you have done on the case by annotating, creating voice commentary, seeking and incorporating feedback from other users to create a short and concise summary video for a case. You can create as many summary vidoes as you'd like - each may serve a different prupose e.g. one summary video may be used in your conference presentation, another may be used in your X (former Twitter) feed and yet another may be used as a teaching tool in your class.

Instrumentor makes it incrediably simple to create summary videos.
