## Uploading a case

You can upload any mp5 file from your local storage, it could be a laptop, desktop or an external storage attached to your laptop or desktop.

### Steps

Sure, I can improve the formatting and wording of the steps in markdown. Here's a revised version:

1. **Navigate to "My Cases"**
2. **Click on the "Upload New Case" button**
3. **Select your case type:**

   - Choose the appropriate option from the "Case Type" dropdown. If your case type is not listed, you can manually type the name. Instrumentor will remember it for future use.

4. **Choose the procedure type:**

   - Select the relevant option from the "Procedure Type" dropdown. This selection helps determine the default evaluation form to use when seeking performance evaluations.

5. **Upload the case video:**

   - Ensure the video is in MP4 format, then select the case video.

6. **Initiate the upload:**

   - Click "Upload". Instrumentor will create a tile on your "My Cases" screen and display the upload progress. Once the upload is complete, the video will undergo post-processing and become ready for use or review.
