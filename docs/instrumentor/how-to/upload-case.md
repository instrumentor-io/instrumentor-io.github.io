## Uploading a case

You can upload any mp5 file from your local storage, it could be a laptop, desktop or an external storage attached to your laptop or desktop.

### Steps

1. NAvigate to "My Cases"
2. Click on the "Upload New Case" button
3. Select your case type from the "Case Type" dropdown. If the case you are operating is not found in this list, go ahead and type the name. Instrumentor will remember it for future. (Instrumentor remembers your case types individually)
4. Select appropriate value from "Procedure Type" dropdown. We use procedure type to determine which default evaluation form to use when you ask someone to evaluate your performance.
5. Select the case video. We support MP4 files for upload
6. Click "Upload". Instrumentor will create a tile on your "My Cases" screen and show you the progress of upload. Once the uplaod is complete, your video goes to post-processing and is then ready for use/review.

Following video shows how to uplaod a video from the web-portal.
