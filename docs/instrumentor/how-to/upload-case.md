## Uploading a case

You can upload any mp4 file from your local computer. While uploading you can mark areas that may contain PHI. Instrumentor will remove those areas before making the case available for viewing.

### Steps

1. **Navigate to "My Cases"**
2. **Click on the "Upload New Case" button**
3. **Select your case type:**
   - Choose the appropriate option from the "Case Type" dropdown. If your case type is not listed, you can manually type the name. Instrumentor will remember it for future use.
4. **Choose the procedure type:**
   - Select the relevant option from the "Procedure Type" dropdown. This selection helps determine the default evaluation form to use when seeking performance evaluations.
5. **Upload the case video:**
   - Ensure the video is in MP4 format, then select the case video.
6. **Initiate the upload:**
   - Click "Upload". Instrumentor will create a tile on your "My Cases" screen and display the upload progress. Once the upload is complete, the video will undergo post-processing and become ready for use or review.
