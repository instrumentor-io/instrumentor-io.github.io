## Create Drawing Annotation

A drawing annotation feature enables you to create illustrations directly on the video at any given point in time. Annotations serve as an effective means to visually convey important ideas by drawing directly on the video, enhancing communication and understanding. Besides drawing diagrams and text, you can also record a voice commentary to share important highlights during the case. Instrumentor stores your voice note as well as your drawings.
