## Adding tags to case

Tags are an essential organizational tool for managing your cases effectively. You have the freedom to design your own tagging system, as Instrumentor does not impose a specific nomenclature on you. Once you've defined your tags based on your preferred organizational structure, adding tags to a case becomes a straightforward process. You can easily apply tags to a case using either the "My Cases" screen or the "Case Details" screen.

Tags come with two visibility levels:

- **Public Tags**: These are tags that are visible to everyone you share the case with. If the case isn't shared, the tags remain visible only to you.
- **Private Tags**: Private tags are meant for your eyes only. When you mark a tag as private and share the case with other users, they won't have access to view these tags.

Searching for cases using tags is a powerful technique to retrieve specific cases. To initiate a search, simply begin typing the tag value in the search box, and Instrumentor will retrieve all cases with matching tags. This search function is "hungry," meaning it actively finds cases with matching characters as you type for a more efficient search experience.
