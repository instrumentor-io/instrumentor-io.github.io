## Cases Shared with Me

"Cases Shared with Me" page lists all the cases other users have shared with you. The "share type" can be either "Evaluation Request" for "Demonstration/Discussion". When the "share type" is an "Evaluation Request", you can review the case and complete evaluation form linked for evaluations. The eval forms can differ from instance to instance. Default form is selected based on type of surgery, for laparoscopic case we use GOALS (Global Operative Assessment of Laparoscopic Skills) & for robot-assisted cases we use GEARS (Global Evaluative Assessment of Robotic Skills).

You can view the cases grouped by "Shared By", "Case Type" and "Share Date".
