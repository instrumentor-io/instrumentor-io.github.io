## My Cases

My Cases is your secure vault of all the cases you have ever recorded or uplaoded to Instrumentor. The cases, by default, are arranged as tiles sorted by 'Case Date' You can visualize the cases by selecting option from "Group By" drop-down located toward top-right corner. You can view cases grouped by 'Case Type' or 'Case Date'.

**Here's how a typical 'My Cases' page looks like**
